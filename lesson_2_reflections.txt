want to commit. Working disrectory is where you are coding and repository is where history of
changes are saved. Have the three parts makes easier to think better about the changes than will

manually?
Some pros are doing faster without acknowledge about changes of my partner, but it is good
when merge cannot be automatic due to conflict with some code, then you need to check to 
take the best desicion for the code.
