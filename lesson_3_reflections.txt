When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When i work remotelly, using another computer or i want to perform any change since any place

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because maybe not all changes i want them on my local computer, maybe i need to verify which changes can be useful

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks is a feature available only for HitHub, then you can use it to copy code from some colleague, clone is used when need to pass the repository
to your local and also between local. Branch is used only on the local and it is used to test other features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Because you can compare changes with yours and done a merge fixing conflicts

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

A solution could be using email sending changes done for code, the hard part will be merge the 
different codes without create a conflict later because missing variables or so on, easy part if code is
small changes will be done fast.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

When you are working with more people, they needs to verify if your changes can affect the master branch,
if a second branch is created you can get feedback about changes and if they are ok, they can be added to
master branch. Code control and avoid reworking and issues with mixed code.
